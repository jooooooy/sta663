# Sta663 Final Project
## Aijing Gao and Jingyi Lin
This repository collects python codes, which are compiled as a python package named epiabc, to perform ABC inference of infectious disease epidemics, adapted from the paper "A tutorial introduction to Bayesian inference for stochastic epidemic models using Approximate Bayesian Computation" by Kypraios, Neal and Prangle. 

### Tutorial for downloading and importing epiabc from terminal

```console
aijing@aijing-X555LAB:~$ git clone https://github.com/jooooooy/sta663.git
```
Then set the file of sta663 as working directory
